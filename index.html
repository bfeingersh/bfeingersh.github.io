    <p>Hello world! My name is Ben Feingersh. I am a soon-to-be member of the SIB Spring '14 class in Technical Marketing. I graduated from Northeastern University in Fall 2012 and worked at Merrill Communications for the better part of the last year.</p>
    <p>I love gaming, rock climbing, biking, and travel. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/feingersh">Here's my twitter!</a> It's not funny.</p>
    <p>I like to think I'm a pretty cool cat. Like the cat up above.</p>
